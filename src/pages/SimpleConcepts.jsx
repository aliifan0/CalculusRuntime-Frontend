            A real-valued function gives one real number as its answer. The number of inputs tells you the dimension of the input space: <M latex="f(x)" /> uses a line,{" "}
            <M latex="f(x,y)" /> uses a plane, and <M latex="f(x,y,z)" /> uses space. The output is still one number, so you can think of the function as assigning a height, temperature, cost, or density to every allowed input point.
